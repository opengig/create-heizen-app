# CHA - create-heizen-app

A simple command-line tool to scaffold new projects at Heizen.

---

### Template Types (as I have thought of):

- Full Stack NextJs
- NextJs + NestJs Turborepo

---

### Stack (things you can choose) (I might be biased here)

- Husky (Not a bigfan but anyways) (not an optional thing btw)
- Auth - BetterAuth (please don't ask for NextAuth, it doesn't exist anymore)
- Database - PostgreSQL (most of the time) / MongoDB (sometimes)
- ORM - Drizzle (yes) / Prisma (kinda)
- API Layer - trpc (but optional) + react-query
- Email - Resend (maybe will switch to nodemailer)
- Ratelimit - Upstash Redis

---

### Good to have (not must to have)

- deployment specific configurations (I don't know what I mean here but will see)

---

### AI? (hmm.., I'm not sure yet) (this will be optional)

- ai-sdk with a basic chat app implementation

---

### UI? (you already know, don't ask)

---

Things beyond all these to setup a new project are basically tech debt. If you need more, **BYOS** (bring your own solution)
